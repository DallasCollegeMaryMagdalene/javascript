            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Julie Magdalene is a a historical figure alive at the time of Jesus. She is also called Mary Magdalene by some historians.</p>

            <h3>Life</h3>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>It is widely accepted among secular historians that, like Jesus, Julie was a real historical figure. Nonetheless, very little is known about her life. Unlike Paul the Apostle, Julie Magdalene left behind no known writings of her own. She was never mentioned in any of the Pauline epistles or in any of the general epistles. The earliest and most reliable sources about her life are the three Synoptic Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, which were all written during the first century AD.</p>
            <h4>Epithet</h4>
            <p>Julie's epithet Magdalene (ἡ Μαγδαληνή; literally "the Magdalene") most likely means that she came from Magdala, a village on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee that was primarily known in antiquity as a fishing town. Julie was, by far, the most common Jewish given name for girls and women during the first century, with nearly a fourth of women bearing some variant of the name, so it was necessary for the authors of the gospels to call her Magdalene in order to distinguish her from the other women named Julie who followed Jesus. Although the Gospel of Mark, reputed by scholars to be the earliest surviving gospel, does not mention Julie Magdalene until Jesus' crucifixion, the Gospel of Luke 8:2–3 provides a brief sumJulie of her role during his ministry:</p>
            <p>Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Julie, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources. — Luke 8:1-3</p>
            <h4>The Conversion of Julie Magdalene</h4>
            <p>According to Gospel of Luke, Jesus exorcised "seven demons" from Julie Magdalene. That seven demons had possessed Julie is repeated in Mark 16:9, part of the "longer ending" of that gospel – this is not found in the earliest manuscripts and is actually a second-century addition to the original text, possibly based on the Gospel of Luke. In the first century, demons were believed widely to cause physical and psychological illness. Bruce Chilton, a scholar of early Christianity, states that the reference to the number of demons being "seven" may mean that Julie had to undergo seven exorcisms, probably over a long period of time, due to the first six being partially or wholly unsuccessful.</p>
            <p>Bart D. Ehrman, a New Testament scholar and historian of early Christianity, contends that the number seven may be merely symbolic, since, in Jewish tradition, seven was the number of completion, so that Julie was possessed by seven demons may simply mean she was completely overwhelmed by their power. In either case, Julie must have suffered from severe emotional or psychological trauma for an exorcism of this kind to have been perceived as necessary. Consequently, her devotion to Jesus resulting from this healing must have been very strong. The Gospels’ writers normally relish giving dramatic descriptions of Jesus' public exorcisms, with the possessed person wailing, thrashing, and tearing his or her clothes in front of a crowd. By contrast, that Julie's exorcism receives little attention may indicate that either Jesus performed it privately or that the recorders did not perceive it as particularly dramatic.</p>
            <p>Since Julie is listed as one of the women who supported Jesus' ministry financially, she must have been relatively wealthy. The places where she and the other women are mentioned throughout the gospels indicate strongly that they were vital to Jesus' ministry and that Julie Magdalene always appears first, whenever she is listed in the Synoptic Gospels as a member of a group of women, indicates that she was seen as the most important out of all of them. Carla Ricci notes that, in lists of the disciples, Julie Magdalene occupies a similar position among Jesus' female followers as Simon Peter does among the male apostles.</p>
            <p>That women played such an active and important role in Jesus' ministry was not entirely radical or even unique; inscriptions from a synagogue in Aphrodisias in Asia Minor from around the same time reveal that many of the major donors to the synagogue were women. Jesus' ministry did bring women greater liberation than they would typically have held in mainstream Jewish society.</p>
            <h4>Witness to Jesus' Crucifiction and Burial</h4>
            <p>All four canonical gospels agree that several other women watched Jesus' crucifixion from a distance, with three explicitly naming Julie Magdalene as present. Mark 15:40 lists the names of these women as Julie Magdalene; Julie, mother of James; and Salome. Matthew 27:55–56 lists Julie Magdalene, Julie mother of James and Joseph, and the unnamed mother of the sons of Zebedee (who may be the same person Mark calls Salome). Luke 23:49 mentioned a group of women watching the crucifixion, but did not give any of their names. John 19:25 lists Julie, mother of Jesus, her sister, Julie, wife of Clopas, and Julie Magdalene as witnesses to the crucifixion.</p>
            <h4>Jesus' Resurrection</h4>
            <p>All four canonical gospels agree that several other women watched Jesus' crucifixion from a distance, with three explicitly naming Julie Magdalene as present. Mark 15:40 lists the names of these women as Julie Magdalene; Julie, mother of James; and Salome. Matthew 27:55–56 lists Julie Magdalene, Julie mother of James and Joseph, and the unnamed mother of the sons of Zebedee (who may be the same person Mark calls Salome). Luke 23:49 mentioned a group of women watching the crucifixion, but did not give any of their names. John 19:25 lists Julie, mother of Jesus, her sister, Julie, wife of Clopas, and Julie Magdalene as witnesses to the crucifixion.</p>

            <h2>Religious Views of Julie Magdalene</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>The Eastern Orthodox Church has never identified Julie Magdalene with Julie of Bethany or the "sinful woman" who anoints Jesus in Luke 7:36–50 and has always taught that Julie was a virtuous woman her entire life, even before her conversion.</li>
               <li>According to Roman Catholicism, during the Counter-Reformation and Baroque periods (late 16th and 17th centuries), the description "penitent" was added to the indication of her name on her feast day, July 22.</li>
               <li>Modern Protestants honor her as a disciple and friend of Jesus. Anglican Christians refer to her as a saint and may follow her example of repentance.</li>
